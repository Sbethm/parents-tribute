            <p>My parents are wonderful people, but like any child growing up, I would often wonder, "Why mom and dad? Why!" Whether it because of chores or going to on a scary ride at Disney World.</p>
            <p>I had a lot of anxiety as a child (I still do!), and my parents knew this. Anxiety has been running rampant on both sides of my family, but despite this, I never its ugly face on my parents. Instead, they pushed me beyond my limits and made me face my fears.
