        <h2>Before They Met</h2>
        <p class="p--first">My parents were married at a young age. So, many of the stories they share are about their lives together.</p>
        <p class="p--last">They met, were married, and had children all at a young age, and they couldn't be happier with how their lives turned out. But, what happened before that?</p>
        <div class="grid--timeline">
            <div class="grid__box--timeline dad">Steven</div>
            <div class="grid__box--timeline mom">Lori</div>
            <!---------Dad's Grid Boxes---------->
            <div class="grid__box--timeline f-1">Born in 1969, the same year that man  first stepped on the moon.</div>
            <div class="grid__box--timeline f-2">He attended a small Catholic school.</div>
            <div class="grid__box--timeline f-3">During recess in the 4th grade, he gashed his elbow while playing a fierce game of football. This resulted in four stitches which he is still very proud of today.</div>            
            <div class="grid__box--timeline f-4">When he was thirteen, he camped out in his backyard and stayed up all night, feeling like a young adventurer.</div>
            <div class="grid__box--timeline f-5">He ran his first high school track meet, the 100 yard dash, and won third place. For his first track meet, that's not too shabby!</div>
            <div class="grid__box--timeline f-6">He was in a car accident, of course, it was "not his fault", which lead to more stitches but this time in his forehead. Because of this, he had to sit out his senior year homecoming football game. While he may have missed the game, he probably got plenty of attention for the ladies.</div>
            <div class="grid__box--timeline f-7">He took the leading role of Jesus during his high school senior year which from then on became an annual event. No doubt each year ever Jesus was unable to capture the magic of his first performance.</div>
            <div class="grid__box--timeline f-8">He had a dream of marrying a beautiful wife and having children to enjoy playing games with. This dream came to bite him in the butt because his kids kick his ass at those games now!</div>

            <div class="grid__box--timeline m-2">She attended a (large for a small town) public school.</div>
            <div class="grid__box--timeline m-3">She cut off one of her pigtails in the bathroom. Perhaps to see if she had the makings of a future trend setter? Let's just say, this career path has panned out yet.</div>
            <div class="grid__box--timeline m-4">She had skied half of a bunny slope when she realized this daredevil sport wasn't for her.</div>
            <div class="grid__box--timeline m-5">She performed the lead role in a junior high school play.</div>
            <div class="grid__box--timeline m-6">In a second attempt to try the daredevil's life, she rode a in the Appalachians. This second and last attempt led her to conclude that such daring feats were not for her.</div>
            <div class="grid__box--timeline m-7">In the pine forest behind her grandmother's house, she and her cousins made secret camps. No doubt she was hoping to begin an early career as a hermit there.</div>
