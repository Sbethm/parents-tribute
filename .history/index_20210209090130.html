          <h2>The Parents and I</h2>
          <div class="text">
            <p>My brother and I were raised by my parents in Southern Louisiana. It was a great childhood. Who can ask for more than blow-up pools and mud parties? My parents gave us so much love growing up. We didn't know how lucky we were.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My parents must have been angels to have been able to put up with a child like me. I got into every kind of mess imaginable. Broken nose? Check! Stitches in lip? Check! Dog attack? Check! And every moment was fun! - for me, not my parents.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Despite all the trouble and trips to the Emergency Room, I don't remember them ever panicking or getting upset- not during those moments at least!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Nope, they only got mad when I cut my own hair, cut my brother's hair, wondered over to the neighbor's house, or didn't pick up my toys. The usual things</p>
            <p>The best thing my parents have done for me was face my fears.</p>
