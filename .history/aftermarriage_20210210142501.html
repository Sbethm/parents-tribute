            <!---------Dad's Grid Boxes---------->
            <div class="grid-box f-1">Born in 1969. The same year that man  first stepped on the moon.</div>

            <div class="grid-box f-3">During recess in the 4th grade, he gashed his elbow while playing a rough-and-tumble game of football. This resulted in four stitches (for a nine year old thatâ€™s a lot of stitches!)</div>            
            <div class="grid-box f-4">When he was thirteen, he camped in the backyard and stayed up all night.</div>
            <div class="grid-box f-5">He ran his first high school track meet, the 100 yard dash, and won third place. For the first track meet, that's not too shabby!</div>
            <div class="grid-box f-6">He was in a car accident, "not his fault", which lead to more stitches but this time in his forehead. Because of this, he had to sit out his senior year homecoming football game.</div>
            <div class="grid-box f-7">Having the lead role as Jesus during my high school senior year. It was the first annual Easter Passion play the school performed.</div>
            <div class="grid-box f-8">I remember a dream I had where I met a beautiful girl, at a homecoming dance, who I eventually married and we had two terrific kids who eventually married and gave me two more kids to enjoy time with.</div>

            <div class="grid-box m-3">She cut off one of her pigtails in the bathroom. Perhaps to see if she had the makings of a hairstylist? Let's just say, this career path ended here.</div>
            <div class="grid-box m-4">She had skied half of a bunny slope when she realized this daredevil sport wasn't for her.</div>
            <div class="grid-box m-5">She performed the lead role in a junior high school play.</div>
            <div class="grid-box m-6">After a white knuckled horse ride in the Appalachians, she discovered that she was not meant to lead a life of adventure</div>
            <div class="grid-box m-7">made camps with her cousins in the Ritchie woods.</div>
