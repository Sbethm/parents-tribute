            <p>My parents are wonderful people. . .who also happened to force me to face one of my greatest fears- falling. 
              You might think that a <em>good parent</em> would not <em>force</em> their child to face an immobilizing fear. 
              Granted, I wasn't "immobilize", but I vividly remember standing in line with my parents sobbing and begging 
              them not to put me on this ride. Now, after hearing this, maybe you are thinking how terribly cruel that would 
              be for a child, and may be you can even reference a few books about child rearing that tell how such an event 
              might traumatize and stunt the mental well-being of a child. I want to stop you here. My parents completely
              loved me, though I firmly believe that I was a child bestowed on them as some cruel test of their patience, 
              and so, they new me all too well, and they understood my irrational fears and dramatic nature. It was because 
              of this event that I think I was able to do many of the things I do today.</p>
