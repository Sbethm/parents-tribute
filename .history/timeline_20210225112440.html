        <h2>Before They Met</h2>
        <p class="p--first">My parents were married at a young age. So, many of the stories they share are about their lives together.</p>
        <p class="p--last">They met, were married, and had children all at a young age, and they couldn't be happier with how their lives turned out. But, what happened before that?</p>
