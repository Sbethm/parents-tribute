         <h2>Adventure at Splash Mountain</h2> 
         <p>The best thing my parents have done for me was push me. They pushed me to face my fears.</p>
         <p>When I was young (but probably not as young as you think), I was crying while standing in line for the Splash Mountain ride at Disney World. I was terrified. I didn't want to fall screaming over the edge of a waterfall. Those people one the ride were screaming, so of course, it had to be terror . What could be fun in that? But, despite my tears, my parents forced me on to the ride.</p>
         <p>At the time, I thought that I was going to die on that ride. Each gentle dip in the ride's river, I thought would bring my doom.</p>
